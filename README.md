# DogsBehaviorEvaluation
creating a model in python that can detect dogs&amp;toys in a given overhead view video with TensorFlow using deep learning. the model will be able to detect any object if you build a graph accordingly to the TomArielDogBehaviorEvalutionProject.docx file . Demo of detection is included . we made the script into .exe file in order to make it more user friendly because now you wont have to download TensorFlow and the python environment if you wish to use the program.


Special regards to Ariel Lowenstein, my partner in this Project.
